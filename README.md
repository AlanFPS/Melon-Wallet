## About

**Melon Wallet** is a cute expenses & income tracker. I've always used different tools to keep
track of my finances, but I could never find something attractive and functional at the same time.

The application was built with Express, Node & MongoDB database. It also incorporates an
Exchange Rate API which renders based on user currency input into the database when they add
a new transaction.
